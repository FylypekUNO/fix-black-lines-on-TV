# TV screen fixing tool

Do you have black horizontal lines on part of your TV and want to get rid of them? \
Well, I have a solution for you: **Don't!** \
Just add more lines to the point where you can't recognize which part of the screen is broken!

### To configure - click on the tray icon
### Settings:
- Pattern height
- Brush size
- Pattern offset
- Alpha channel (testing only, Windows doesn't like transparency, set to 1 to visualize how broken your screen is)


### Todo: 
- Saving settings
